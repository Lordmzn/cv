\ecvitem{\textbf{\nth{4} Aug 2021 - oggi}}{\large Digital solutions manager}
\ecvitem{Main tasks and responsibilities}{I am in charge of coordinating and designing ENERSEM's IT solutions, starting with EMS, a cloud-based platform for storing energy monitoring data from industrial plants and other buildings. I supervise the work of the IT company in charge of development, participate in the design of the architecture and functionality, directly program some prototype features, and manage the cloud servers and associated services (mail, analytics, and the like). I also supervise research projects, developing some tasks directly, and contribute to writing projects.}

\ecvitem{\textbf{\nth{6} Mar 2018 - \nth{8} Jul 2020}}{\large Consultant for ENERSEM}
\ecvitem{Main tasks and responsibilities}{As a private consultant, I am helping a new startup in modelling energy systems ranging from small factories, to offices and buildings. I deal with big data analysis and machine learning to extract new insights and to distill advices for improving the use of energy, its efficiency and effectiveness. I also deal with control system design, in particular by using model predictive control strategies, to close the loop between field measurements and devices such as heating and cooling systems.}
\ecvitem{}{Finally, I'm overviewing and working on funded research projects granted to ENERSEM: from 2018 to December 2019 I've worked at TEPORE on a Model Predictive Control algorithm for smart thermostats and on analysis of room occupancy data with Support Vector Machines and other unsupervised algorithms. From 2020, I'm working on LombHe@t, where we integrate the modelling of heat pumps into the control algorithm and we analyze consumption profiles of district heating users. }

\ecvitem{\textbf{\nth{2} Feb 2018 - \nth{3} Apr 2018}}{\large Modelling and managing an alpine hydroelectric plant}
\ecvitem{Main tasks and responsibilities}{As a private consultant, I developed and applied algorithms for modelling the historical operations of an hydroelectric reservoir (Cancano lake, North of Italy) in multiple periods, with particular focus on evolving hydroelectric markets. The research aimed at quantifying the adaptive response of system management, and at improving the assessment of system performance. To this end, we applied algorithms of Inverse Reinforcement Learning to a lumped, conceptual model of the hydroelectric plant.}

\ecvsection{Education and training}
		
\ecvitem{\textbf{Oct 2014 - 17 Jan 2018}}{\large PhD in Information Technology, \emph{cum laude}}
\ecvitem{Title}{Beyond full rationality: modelling tradeoff dynamics in multiobjective water management}
\ecvitem{Principal subject}{We have been researching how to model the behavior of human operators in water systems with multiple targets. We expand the traditional normative approaches based on the assumption of a utility maximizer into a multi objective context, where multiple, equivalently optimal behaviors co-exist. We develop a non-parametric approach based on inverse reinforcement learning to identify the multiple utility functions of an operator, and a parametric agent based negotiation protocol to identify the operator’s tradeoff among multiple utilities and the tradeoff evolution in time. The methodologies are demonstrated on both synthetic case studies and real settings.}
